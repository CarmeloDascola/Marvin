## Usage
###### the `config.yaml` file
There has to be a `config.yaml` file in the same location as he `client.py` file is. The file has to be formatted as *yaml* and some *yaml-specific* features cant be used becuase of the `yaml.safe_load` function being used. The file must contain credentials as the following example shows.
```yaml
token: TokenGoesHere    # Discord bot token
username: MyUsername01  # moodle3.gvid.cz username
password: Password123   # moodle3.gvid.cz password
```
The [moodle](https://moodle3.gvid.cz) credentials are used for the `!supl` command which gives you substitutions for the current/following day depending on the document presence as they are needed to login in the course.
